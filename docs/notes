The main goal of this program was not to make the best calculator.
Rather, I wanted to:
 *  Practice using Go and GitHub.
 *  Organize my code efficiently and professionally.
 *  Present my code as professionally as possible.
 *  Get experience using version control, commits, pushes, etc.

Since I am predominantly self-taught, a lot of my naming schema and organization is not reflective
of professional standards. However, I tried my best to conform to standards where I was knowledgeable.


The following is a test equation that I used frequently:
-2+(5.2*6-88/(9-8))-(8*5)+9/1
It should give an answer of -89.8. I checked this result against several other calculators.
